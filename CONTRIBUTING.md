  do not create an issue! Use the PR description for that
* Issues are handled with a much lower priority than pull requests
* Use this [template](https://github.com/vapeasnl/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  when reporting issues. Please search for duplicates first!
* Pull requests must be made against the [correct version](https://github.com/vapeasnl)
* There are restrictions on the kind of [changes allowed in stable series](https://github.com/)
